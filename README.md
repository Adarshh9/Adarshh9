## About me
Hi!! I'm **Adarsh Kesharwani**. I build and research applied AI, currently focused on **taxonomy-aware capsule networks (TaxoCapsNet)** and related ML systems. I enjoy turning tough research ideas into working code, experimenting with model architectures, and shipping small, useful tools. You’ll find a mix of research implementations, datathon projects, and useful engineering utilities across my repos.

---

## 🚀 Current focus
- 🔭 **TaxoCapsNet (Taxonomy-Aware Capsule Networks)** — exploring hierarchical / taxonomy-aware representations for structured classification problems.  
- 🧩 Building reproducible research code, model training pipelines, and practical demos.  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on AI/ML research and engineering projects.

## ✨ Quick tips for newcomers to my repos
- Check the README inside each project for quick start / environment setup.  
- Most projects expect a Python 3.8+ environment and use `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml` for dependencies.  
- If a project uses Docker, there's usually a `Dockerfile` and a `run.sh` for local testing.

---

## ⚡ Fun / Next things on my list
- Clean, documented reproducible experiments for TaxoCaps + public benchmark scripts.  
- Small demo web apps for a couple of research projects (so people can test models without setup).  
- More tutorials and blog posts explaining model design choices.

If anything here sparks your curiosity — ping me. I love talking about models, code design, and weird edge-cases in ML pipelines. ✌️
